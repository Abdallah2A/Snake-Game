# Snake Game
This is a simple Snake game implemented in Python using the Turtle module.

## Description
The Snake game involves controlling a snake using arrow keys to navigate it around the screen. The objective is to eat as much food as possible without colliding with the snake's own body or the walls. As the snake consumes food, it grows longer, making the game more challenging.

## Features
- Snake movement controlled by arrow keys (up, down, left, right)
- Random placement of food on the screen
- Score tracking
- High score saved to a file
- Game over when the snake collides with itself or the wall
